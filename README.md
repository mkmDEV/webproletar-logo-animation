# webproletar-logo-animation
I wanted to try out CSS3 animations, and created a responsive remake of an old GIF

Webproletar.hu was a "blog-type" website developed by my friend and first mentor in World Wide Web in the early 2000's. Every line of code was written in Notepad, and we learnt so much from static HTML 4.01 pages, iframes, and so on.

When I was studiing at Eötvös Loránd University Budapest, HTML5 and CSS3 was released and I wanted to try out animations, responsivity so remame the old 120×60 px gif logo to a pure CSS one.
